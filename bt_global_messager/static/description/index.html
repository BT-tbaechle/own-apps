        <p>
            The Global Messager allows you to send instant or time-based messages through different
            channels to all users in Odoo. This can help you in all different situations for example
            can you inform users about an upcoming server maintenance so they can save and log out on time,
            welcome a new employee, celebrate the current employee of the month,
            release important internal information or the date of an upcoming event
            or simply wish everyone a nice and relaxing weekend.
        </p>

        <p>
            So how does it work? It's very easy, in the Discuss App und Global Messager you can create
            notifications which represent either an event for which you might want to send several messages
            or just a one off information.
        </p>

        <div class="oe_demo oe_picture oe_screenshot">
            <img src="" style="max-width: 75%; position: relative; left: 13%;">
        </div>

        <p>
            Here you have the ability to specify a title, message and icon for the notification as well as
            choose different communication channels. So far we provide the options to display an Odoo
            internal pop-up (displayed as information or warning) or a desktop notification.
            The latter one is particularly useful as the user will be notified no matter what he/she
            is currently doing on his computer as long as he is logged into Odoo in one of his browser tabs.
            If he/she clicks on the pop-up the user will be taken directly to the Odoo browser tab so he can
            take action.
        </p>

        (Only possible for Administration / Configuration and Administration / Settings group)

        <h5 class="oe_slogan">Time-Based</h5>
        <p>
            The first step is to configure the information regarding the message itself such as the title,
            message text and icon as well as the desired notification channels. Now the way to think of this is
            that these are the default values which can be adapted later on if needed as you have the ability to
            send multiple messages for a notification. To further illustrate this lets puck up again our example of
            an upcoming server maintenance.
        </p>

        <div class="oe_demo oe_picture oe_screenshot">
            <img src="" style="max-width: 75%; position: relative; left: 13%;">
        </div>

        <p>
            Now for the server maintenance we most likely have a set date and time on which it will take place.
            This can be set in the Event Time field. Now you already have the basic setup completed.
        </p>
        <p>
            After saving you can now setup the individual notification times when a message will be sent
            out to the users. If you add a new notification time you will be prompted with a pop-up to
            enter all the required information. Here you first need to set a type which can either be 'relative'
            or 'absolute'. The 'absolute' type lets you specify an absolute point in time where the message
            will be send out. With 'relative' you have the ability to specify a time offset relative to the event time
            set on the notification. For this you need to specify an offset unit (minutes, hours, days or weeks)
            as well as the desired offset where negative values will result in a message being sent before the
            event time, while a positive value will send out a message after the event.
        </p>
        <div class="oe_demo oe_picture oe_screenshot">
            <img src="" style="max-width: 75%; position: relative; left: 13%;">
        </div>
        <div class="oe_demo oe_picture oe_screenshot">
            <img src="" style="max-width: 75%; position: relative; left: 13%;">
        </div>
        <p>
            On each notification time you can choose one or more notification channels which shall be used for this
            message. You also have the ability to customize the message that will be sent at this specific time
            by checking the "Customize Message" box otherwise the defaults from the notification will be used.
        </p>
        <div class="oe_demo oe_picture oe_screenshot">
            <img src="" style="max-width: 75%; position: relative; left: 13%;">
        </div>
        <p>
            Now that everything is set up properly you can save and let the system handle the rest.
            Each minute a scheduler is run which checks if there are due messages which need to be sent. If that's the
            case, a message will be sent out to the users via the selected channels. The corresponding entry in the
            notification times will be marked as sent.
        </p>

        <h5 class="oe_slogan">Instant</h5>
        <p>
            If there is no need to set a specific event time you can check the "Send manually" box which will
            show the "Send" button at the very top. This allows you to send out the notification manually
            whenever it seems appropriate. Each time the button is pressed, an entry in the notification times table
            is created with the current timestamp.
        </p>
